    <h1 style="color: purple;">My First Week at AkiraChix</h1>
    <p1>It has been two weeks since we moved into <a href="https://akirachix.com/"><b>AkiraChix</b></a> Campus. I would like to highlight my experience during the first week of my stay.</p1>
    <p2>I would term the whole week as <b>Orientation Week</b>, however the orientation was done in steps so that we would not be overwhelmed by the whole experience. I found 
        the approach quite perfect as it allowed us to digest the information in bits and it made adjusting to the new environment easier since some of us were from different 
        countries</p2>

        <h3><b>Orientation Meeting with Parents</b></h3>
        <p>On 1st February when we came, the institution held a meeting with our parents before they signed the contract. We were also present at the meeting. 
            <span>The meeting was held so that the parents would be told the details of the program. What the program entailed, what role they played, what role ,we, the students played 
                what role the instituion played. They were informed about the benefits that will accrue from us taking the program and what requirements we will have to meet to be able 
                to graduate. They were called upon to check up on us from time to time to see how we are doing and to also encourage us when things get tough. They were
                informed that we would not be allowed to leave the campus until after graduation. 
                Our parents got to understand the consequences of exiting the program and the conditions that would lead to us being expelled by the institution. Afterwards they signed 
                a contract with the institutionand said their goodbyes.
